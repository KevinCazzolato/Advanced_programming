This project is a Python implementation of a stack data structure that also includes an expression evaluator. The stack is designed to manage data using Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) logic, supporting typical stack operations like pushing and popping elements. Additionally, the project features custom error handling to manage stack underflows, and it uses the stack for processing and evaluating mathematical or logical expressions.

The Stack class offers core functionalities such as adding (push) and removing (pop) elements, while also providing a string representation for easy visualization of the stack's state. An EmptyStackException is included to handle cases where an operation is attempted on an empty stack, making the system more robust.

The Expression class utilizes the stack for evaluating expressions, allowing for straightforward manipulation and calculation of stack-based expressions. This forms the foundation for potential extension to various mathematical operations. The project is implemented entirely in Python, requiring no external dependencies, and is easily run using a Python interpreter.
